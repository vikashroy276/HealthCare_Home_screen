      "question": "How Home samples collection works?",
      "answer": "Our process is simple and hassle-free. Once you complete your booking by selecting the required tests and your preferred collection time, a highly trained phlebotomist will visit your home to collect the sample while following strict safety standards. The collected sample is then securely delivered to our partner labs for testing in compliance with safety guidelines. After the tests are completed, your reports are shared directly to your registered email, along with the option to avail a free doctor consultation."

    {
      "question": "When will I get my reports?",
      "answer": "Reports are usually delivered within 24 to 48 hours on your registered email and app."

    {
      "question": "Is home sample collection safe?",
      "answer": "Yes, all phlebotomists follow strict hygiene and safety protocols during sample collection."
